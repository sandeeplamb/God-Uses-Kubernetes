# God must be using Kubernetes !!

Gods must be using Kubernetes to manage humans birth cycle. God must be Certified-Kubernetes-Admin.

Lets Prove

## What is Reincarnation
Reincarnation is the philosophical or religious concept that an aspect of a living being starts a new life in a different physical body or form after each biological death.
 
And in a normal life cycle, you follow some sequence

1. You born,
2. You do some tasks in a life (your Karma's)
3. You marry
4. You have kids
5. You get old 
6. You die 
7. Then re-born and repeat from 1-6 unless you met Supreme Conciousness

I always puzzeled that how busy God might be in order to take care of all these tasks as everyday people dies and re-born.

Not long ago, I learned new technology i.e. [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) an open source Orchestrator for your microservices/containers which was Google project 
Borg before it became what it is today. 

If you are interested in growth of Kubernetes, here are some facts.

[Rise Of Kubernetes](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/08/29/cncf-survey-use-of-cloud-native-technologies-in-production-has-grown-over-200-percent/)

So just wear a God Hat and lets create a **human-as-a-deployment**.

## Human-Conciousness-Storage

As humans lives-dies-repeat in a cycle and his conciousness of all life is accessible in any life, God must be using some sort of persistance storage.

And this storage must be **retained** after every time human dies, but if want we can access it later or bound it to same human in other life.

Kubernetes have same concept of Storage Class, Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim.
